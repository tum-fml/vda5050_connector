# Explanation of Code documentation

## How to use the documentation

1) Download the program [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl).
2) Build the documentation using the following command in the main directory of the repository:

```bash
doxygen doc/Doxyfile
```

3) See the HTML documentation by opening the file `index.html` in the newly created subdirectory `doc/html` using your favorite web browser.
